Implement BigQuery loader with batch insert capabilities

Step 6: Data Processing & Transformation Logic

Build stock price data processor with OHLCV standardization
Create technical indicators calculator (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD)
Implement data quality checks (price validation, volume checks, date consistency)
Add data enrichment (sector classification, market cap categories)
Create standardized output schemas for different data types

Step 7: Database Schema Design

Design BigQuery dataset structure (raw, staging, marts layers)
Create partitioned tables by date for efficient querying
Set up clustering on symbol/ticker for optimal performance
Design Redis data structures for real-time caching
Create indexes and optimize query patterns

Step 8: Local Pipeline Testing

Build standalone pipeline runner for testing
Implement comprehensive logging and error tracking
Create data validation tests for each processing step

Create development environment with Docker

Step 10: DAG Development

Create main daily stock data DAG with market hours awareness
Build intraday price update DAG for real-time data
Implement technical indicators calculation DAG
Create data quality monitoring DAG with alerting
Build historical backfill DAG for new symbols

Step 11: Custom Operators & Hooks

Develop Alpha Vantage hook for API interactions
Create BigQuery batch loading operator
Build Redis cache refresh operator
Implement data quality check operator with failure handling
Add market hours sensor to prevent weekend runs

Step 12: Airflow Testing & Deployment

Test DAGs locally with Astro CLI
