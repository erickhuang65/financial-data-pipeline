Set up environment variables for API keys and credentials


**Set up Python virtual environment with required packages**
- Create a virtual environment for your project
- Install packages: pandas, requests, google-cloud-bigquery, pydantic, jupyter, python-dotenv

**Install Jupyter Notebook for data exploration**
- Install and test Jupyter in your virtual environment

**Create project folder structure**
- Set up organized directories: /extractors, /transformers, /loaders, /config, /notebooks, /tests, /logs

**Initialize Git repository and create .gitignore**
- Initialize git, create .gitignore for secrets and sensitive files

**Set up environment variables for API keys and credentials**
- Create .env file for your Alpha Vantage API key and BigQuery credentials
- Test that both services authenticate properly

Since you're already in your `financial-data-pipeline` directory, you're ready to start setting up your Python development environment.
